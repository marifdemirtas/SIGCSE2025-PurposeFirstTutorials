Plan 3: Make GET Request
==========================

.. plandisplay:: plans.jsonmake_get_request_code
   :plan: Make GET Request

This is a plan when you want to make a GET request from an API to obtain information. Sending a GET request is similar to going to an URL on your website.

Plan 3 - When to use this plan?
--------------------------------
This plan is used when your goal is to collect information (e.g. such as weather or exchange rates). You can use it if you want to make a request to the API where you do not need to share sensitive information.

Plan 3 - What parts can be customized to use this plan?
-------------------------------------------------------
To use this plan, provide the target url you set earlier, and provide parameters if there are any parameters you would like to share with the API.
