How to communicate with an API?
==============================

Welcome! We have been learning about web servers and HTTP. Today, we will learn how to communicate with an API by sending HTTP requests. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) provide a structured way to ask for information. APIs are hosted on servers, and we (clients) can send requests to them to obtain information.

In this lab, we will go over two common request types: GET and POST. GET requests are used to retrieve information from the server based on some parameters (such as asking the weather in a city). POST requests are used to send information to the server (such as sending a private message).

------------------------------

.. admonition:: Tutorial Structure
   :class: note

   This tutorial is organized around common *patterns* in programs that send requests to APIs, also known as programming plans.

   Each programming plan has a clear goal describing what it helps you achieve, a code template that you can modify for your own use case, and annotations on which areas to change.

   Throughout the tutorial, you will first see real-world examples of how APIs are useful, and then you will see how these examples break down into plans.
